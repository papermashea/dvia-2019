#### Exercises

- Exercise #1: [Right Twice a Day](./1.mapping-time)
In this project, I wanted to visually explore how time could map to natural elements. This interest came from two points of inspiration: the 2019 Climate Stike and a niche pop culture concept known as "technopaganism". 

By mapping speed and color to different aspects of time, I hoped to create the impression of an alarm going off and more drastic consequences occuring across many ecosystems and variables. 

In future iterations, I would like to finish up the following elements:
- mapping sky color to am/pm
- translate clouds to seconds
- apply a random wave to the top of the water rising
- affix the water rising at 50 years and make the water go darker
- map year.progress to lights and seasons to make an animation that slowly grows dark after 2060
